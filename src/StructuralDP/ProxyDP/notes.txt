For Example:
There are 100 students in a class.
There are 20 fields in each student class

when we do any transaction in the related class, system brings all information of all students.

If we want to get only needed fields:
(hibernate - load)
 1- create normal class include 20 fields
 2- create a proxy class include only needed fields
